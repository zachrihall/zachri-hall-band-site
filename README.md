Band site is a project I worked on while in bootcamp the assignment was to create a mock website for a band that shows their tour dates and information about the site.
This was also the last project before we were introduced to React and frameworks so it was all HTML/CSS and a little javascript towards the end. It was really fun
to work on and honestly was one of my favorites.
